			<div class="description" id='about'>
				<p>Back in 2012, I decided to try my hand at creating custom Tumblr themes and tumbled head first into the rabbit hole of coding and web development. Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of building software for an <strong>advertising agency</strong>, a <strong>start-up</strong>, a <strong>huge corporation</strong>, and a <strong>digital product studio</strong>.</p>
				<p>My main focus these days is building accessible user interfaces for our customers at <strong>Klaviyo</strong>. I most enjoy building software in the sweet spot where design and engineering meet — things that look good but are also built well under the hood. In my free time, I've also released an <strong>online video course</strong> that covers everything you need to know to build a web app with the Spotify API.</p>
				<p>When I’m not at the computer, I’m usually rock climbing, reading, hanging out with my wife and two cats, or running around Hyrule searching for <strong>Korok seeds</strong>.</p>
